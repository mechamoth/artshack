	<h1>An Impeccable Demonstration</h1>

	<h2>This is an h2 element, which I want to be blue.</h2>

	<p>This is a standard paragraph.</p>

	<h2>Another h2</h2>

	<p>Here's a normal paragraph.</p>
	<p>Many maps are static two-dimensional, geometrically accurate (or approximately accurate) representations of three-dimensional space, while others are dynamic or interactive, even three-dimensional. Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any space, real or imagined, without regard to context or scale; e.g. brain mapping, DNA mapping and extraterrestrial mapping.</p>

	<p>NOTICE! This "p" element has an orange background, because it's important.</p>

	<p>Now we're back to normal.</p>
