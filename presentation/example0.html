	An Impeccable Demonstration

	This is an h2 element, which I want to be blue.

	This is a standard paragraph.

	Another h2

	Here's a normal paragraph.

	Many maps are static two-dimensional, geometrically accurate (or approximately accurate) representations of three-dimensional space, while others are dynamic or interactive, even three-dimensional. Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any space, real or imagined, without regard to context or scale; e.g. brain mapping, DNA mapping and extraterrestrial mapping.

	NOTICE! This "p" element has an orange background, because it's important.

	Now we're back to normal.
